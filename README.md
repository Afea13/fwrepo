# Project Create Boxes


1-The project uses contextAPI for state management

2- The initial plan was to pass the info through state and render the rectangles
but i ran into the compatability issue with render-hooks for testing. therefore, i changed the logic . 
now the BoxMaker is individually tested , instead of passing the info through state.

3- the temp-proof-of-concept shows my work i did during the research

4- The screen dimensions can be tracked using a custom hook. and then tracking the values and rendering the interfaces for the updated screen dimensions.
